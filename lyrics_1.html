                    You have not felt well for days<br>
                    Stuck in your own scrawny shadow<br>
                    You’ve been feeling rather stressed<br>
                    Worried bout the days to follow
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Your life seems pretty mundane<br>
                    Since she’s no longer around you<br>
                    You’re reminiscing the good days<br>
                    Times you can never go back to
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when the night comes<br>
                    You sit in the corner of your bed<br>
                    With your eyes wide open<br>
                    Trying to move on<br>
                    Trying to get her out of your he ad<br>
                    Trying over and over
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Scattered all around the floor<br>
                    Signs of her long- lasting sadness<br>
                    She thinks about you more and more<br>
                    Worried that you couldn’t care less
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Her life seems pretty mundane<br>
                    Since she’s spending it without you<br>

                    With your eyes wide open<br>
                    Trying to move on<br>
                    Trying to get her out of your he ad<br>

                <p> 
                    Now she’s running down the street<br>
                    To the one she knows she needs<br>
                    And the wind will blow her back<br> 
                    World will help 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    She will fall right in his arms<br> 
                    And two hearts will beat as one<br>
                    No one will remember why<br>
                    There was time

                    I feel green I don't know what it means<br>
                    But I like when you're looking around
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tryin' to realize that things of your past<br>
                    Had the truth that rather be found
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know that heaven is far away but I've got mine here<br>
                    I know that heaven is far away but I've got mine here<br>
                    I know that heaven is far away but I've got mine here<br>
                    I know that heaven is far away but I've got mine here
                </p>
                <p>
                    Down in my town<br>
                    near the missisipi lake<br>
                    Was a great house, with great yard and with great view.<br>
                    It was all in blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nobody in Perth<br>
                    ever tried to knock its door<br>
                    There lived Old Jack with his barrel and his crew.<br>
                    Neither one were new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    I really want to learn to fly<br>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    I really want to see the who cries<br>
                    oh above the skies
                </p>
                <p>
                    Old Jack had a sack,<br>
                    and in this sack he had some crack<br>
                    He spended all days tryin' to improve his skills.<br>
                    But he had paid no bills
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life is like this,<br>
                    Old Jack never shoot to miss<br>
                    In Perth was one man who could get the money back.<br>
                    They told me -Never touch his sack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    I really want to learn to fly<br>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    I really want to see the who cry,<br>
                    oh above the sky
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knocked the door and Old Jack stood right in front of me<br>
                    I tried to show that I don't care that he's as big as tree<br>
                    And once I saw a barrel in his left hand<br>
                    I looked his eyes 'couse i knew my fate
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know that heaven is far but I've got mine here<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soarded into the sky<br>
                    Cry with those who wants cry<br>
                    In a blink of your eye<br>
                    We fly
                </p>
                <p>
                    oh
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll never land, we'll never land, we'll never land,<br>
                    We'll neverl and, we'll never land, we'll never land,<br>
                    We'll never land, we'll never land, we'll never land,<br>
                    We'll never land, we'll never land, we'll never !<br>
                    And we won't try, 'couse we're stuck in this together!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    Oh now I know the art of fly<br>
                    Oh I, Oh I<br>
                    I cry with those who wants to cry<br>
                    Oh above the sky
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh land oh land<br>
                    Oh I will never land<br>

                <h1 class="song-title">Scared of love</h1>
                <p>
                    I’m scared of love<br>
                    I’m scared of being loved<br>
                    Because I’ve hurt so many man<br>
                    And so much pain<br>
                    I gave them with no hope
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m scared of love<br>
                    But I’m also scared of being such a lonely man<br>
                    Oh I’ve hurt so many of them I do not deserve A chance 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when the wind blows in my mind<br> 
                    Deep inside that thing is breaking<br>
                    People leave and people die<br> 
                    With no story to be taken <br>
                    Oh I want to catch those dreams <br>
                    And I want to catch the truth<br>
                    How to find the path I lost <br>
                    Way that could get me to you<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh…
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m scared of love<br>
                    I’m scared of feeling love <br>
                    Because I know there’s no way back <br>
                    From the fields when hearts are dancing all night long
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when the wind blows in my mind <br>
                    Deep inside that thing is breaking <br>

                    With no story to be taken <br>
                    Oh I want to catch those dreams <br>
                    And I want to catch the truth<br>
                    How to find the path I lost <br>
                    Way that could get me to you
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day I’m feeling black <br>
                    Next day I’m feeling white<br>
                    There’s no path to go <br>
                    I’m making another lap<br>
